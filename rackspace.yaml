instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  This instance will come online and perform a series of automatic
  configurations.
  This includes automatic login of a webpagetest user. If you log in to this
  server over RDP, you have to reboot the system so the auto login happens
  again. Otherwise, the tests performed with WebPageTest will have black
  screenshots and video. You will need to manage this system with the Java
  Console in the Control Panel.
  #### Automatic Reboots
  An automatic reboot of the server will be performed 5 minutes after the
  system comes online. Another automatic reboot will be performed once the
  system fails the automatic logon process.
  Do not interupt this automatic reboot process, or your installation will
  not function correctly.
  #### Manual Configuration
  There are two manual configuration steps required. Access your server via the
  Console option in the control panel and perform these steps:
  1. Dismiss the blue Network Device Discovery panel on the right hand side of
  the screen by clicking on the desktop.
  2. Open Internet Explorer, and ensure the WebPageTest Browser Add-on is
  enabled.
  #### Connection Throttling
  Currently, connection throttling is not functional. Your site tests will run
  using the LAN connection setting.
  #### Video Capture
  If you are having trouble with video capture, open the Advanced Settings
  section and ensure the Capture Video option is enabled.
